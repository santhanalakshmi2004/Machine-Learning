1. Regression Task

Identify a unique dataset for regression (each student uses a different dataset).

Provide dataset description.

Implement Linear Regression from scratch (without scikit-learn built-ins).

Verify results with scikit-learn's LinearRegression.

Evaluate model performance using standard metrics (e.g., MSE, RMSE, R²).

2. Classification Task

Identify a unique dataset for classification.

Provide dataset description.

Implement:

Logistic Regression (using scikit-learn)

Naïve Bayes Classifier (using scikit-learn)

Perform k-fold cross-validation.

Evaluate performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Compare performances of Logistic Regression and Naïve Bayes.
